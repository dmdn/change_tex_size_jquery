# Description
The project is designed as an educational one. You can change the size of the HTML text using jQuery.

## Technical task
On the page are two buttons ("Aa-" and "aA +") and a block with text (initially the text size is 12px). Write a script so that when you click on "Aa-" - the text size is reduced by 2px (the minimum size is 8px, if the text is minimal, the button is no longer available for clicks), and when you click on "aA+" - the text size increased by 2px ( the maximum size is 20px, if the text is the maximum size, then the button is no longer available for clicks).
